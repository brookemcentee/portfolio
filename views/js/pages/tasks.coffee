        Tasks are the most important part of the student experience on NextTier. We needed a robust feature set that clearly highlighted relevant tasks, while also communicating task status and action items. Working with a full year of user feedback, I was challenged with creating an attractive, familiar, and easy to use student tasks experience.

        The previous version of student tasks had poor usability due to a lack of hierarchy and visual interest. I worked to ensure our new version fixed these issues, without sacrificing any of its strengths.

        With user stories and requirements in hand, I took to sketching in order to visualize the page layout.

          The tasks page is loaded with information, and students tend to skim through this content quickly. In order to avoid information overload and allow students to immediately digest and engage with the content, I decided to implement a card-based interface. Users can easily scan through many cards to find relevant tasks, without feeling overwhelmed.

          I needed make task progress extremely clear for the users, as this is one of the most important heuristics for the page. Through the use of color coding and iconography, I was able to display the status of each task in a simple and intuitive way.

          After collecting a content inventory of all information and actions on the page, I separated high priority actions and information from the lower priority. By sketching collapsed tasks alongside tasks with fully expanded details, I established the visual hierarchy of the page. The important information was shown in the  collapsed state, with all other content available  when the component has been expanded.

        Illustrator is where my ideas and sketches came to life. I perfected the visual elements and created design consistency.
        <Subsection

          Circles indicating progress are always on the left of its corresponding content. I made this a clear and intentional design paradigm to ensure that student users know where to look and what to look for when searching for their progress per task and per each group of tasks.

        <Subsection

          Although this page holds a lot of information, I wanted to highlight the most relevant content for the user. Dates, progress and task type were the most important elements, so those are always shown. Task details, associated links, attachments and notes are hidden as to not overwhelm the student. The main call-to-action, the start/complete button, is always prominent.

        <Subsection
          title="color"
        >
          When tasks are started, they change from blue to orange, indicating that the task requires more action. Once it is marked complete, the task becomes green, sending the student positive feedback. As tasks are completed, the overall progress circles in the sidebar dynamically fill up with color. These color changes are stimulating to the user, and provide incentive for the student to continue completing tasks..

        With this project, communication with developers was key. Maintaining focus on the goals of the design was paramount to the success of the project. By proactively answering questions and reviewing staging updates, we were able to finish the project with the application staying true to the design.
