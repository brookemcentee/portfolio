        The student-facing mobile app required a complete facelift. After trashing the old app, plagued with inconsistency and outdated design paradigms, our work was cut out for us. We challenged ourselves to think backward, a concept I learned about at a design conference just before starting this project. We started with our end goal, a perfectly smooth mobile experience, and worked backward to figure out what we needed to implement to make that ideal experience a reality.

        Because we were starting from scratch, brainstorming was an essential part of this project. I took the lead on brainstorming and planned out a week of structured two-hour sessions. Each session had a theme to ensure focus and included both solo and collaborative brainstorming.

      <Paragraph

        A tight timeline meant that we had to strictly prioritize our most impactful ideas which, in turn, allowed us to focus on creating an elegant app with a few essential new features. Our design strategy centered around simplification, customization, and optimization.

      <Paragraph
        title="wireframes"
      >
        The initial phase of the project was spent in Balsamiq creating wireframes. Focusing on simplicity and clarity, I was able to get a feel for the navigation and components that would make up the majority of the app. Before wrapping up the project, I held a design review where I received the necessary feedback to move on to mockups.

          Our main goal for the new mobile app was to keep it simple. This meant clear navigation, paring down and reorganizing data, simple transitions, and meaningful iconography.

        <Subsection
          title="iconography"
        >
          I created an iconography set that would act as a language to reduce text, increase screen real estate, and add personality to the mobile app.

        <Subsection

          Emphasizing and optimizing discovery within each feature of the mobile app was imperative.

        Using Zeplin, Slack and Asana as collaboration tools, I worked cross-functionally with the back and front-end development teams to ensure the new mobile app was developed as intended. By regularly checking in with the developers, I minimized miscommunication and prevented waste of development resources.
