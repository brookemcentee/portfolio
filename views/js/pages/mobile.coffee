        The student-facing mobile app required a complete facelift. After trashing the old app plagued with inconsistency and outdated design paradigms, our work was cut out for us. We challenged ourselves to think backward, a concept I learned about at a design conference just before starting this project. We started with our end goal, a perfectly smooth mobile experience, and then worked backward to figure out what we needed to do/implement to make that ideal experience a reality.

        Because we were starting from scratch, brainstorming was an essential part of this project. I took the lead on brainstorming and planned out a week of structured two-hour sessions. Each session had a theme to ensure focus and included both solo and collaborative brainstorming.

        Our tight two-month timeline meant that we had to strictly prioritize our most impactful ideas which, in turn, allowed us to focus on creating an elegant app with a few essential new features. The most impactful design requirements were based on simplification, customization, and optimization.

        I spent the first week of the project in Balsamiq creating wireframes. Focusing on simplicity and clarity, I was able to get a feel for the navigation and components that would make up the majority of the app. At the end of the week, I held a design review where I received the necessary feedback to move on to mockups.
